Services we provided include data analysis, targeted marketing, ROI, graphic design, digital printing, offset printing, post print finishing, promotional products, direct mail, shared mail, and email campaigns.
What really sets us apart from other mail houses is our love of data and reports.

We are now able to dive into our client’s databases and provide them with meaningful information, such as where to market and why. Post mailing, we are able to provide ROI reports that break down mailings by offers, physical attributes, and list type.

This is a job for ERP consultants that want to specialize in data integration. Every company today use between 20-100 different business productivity applications. These applications need to share data with each other in many different ways - to make the business users as informed and productive as possible. The heart of a business is the CRM, ERP or CSM - and most integrations involve these applications - so we are looking for someone that has experience with one or all of those types of applications.
The Role
This role is all about Business Data. Some days this will be working on complex data integrations, the next a virtual integration project and the next focused on cross platform reporting. You will be hands on with building integration solutions for a wide range of clients, while at the same time managing those projects to success.
The primary tasks will include but not be limited to:

4. Training clients on how to manage the integration solution
5. Document the integration scenario
6. Managing your own projects through project meetings, setting expectations.
7. Manage projects to budget
8. Providing feedback on local needs and requirements
9. Building templates to streamline future projects.
What we are looking for?
The ideal person will have a technical knowledge of mid-market ERP or CRM. Ideally you will understand the web services, API's, have a strong grasp of SQL and be confident working with data. You are the kind of person that likes to be challenged, solve problems, and enjoys working independently (inside a very supportive team structure).
- Technical experience with Dynamics Business Central, Dynamics CE, SalesForce, Dynamics GP, NetSuite or F&O
- Experience with SmartConnect, Tibco Scribe, Dell Boomi or Celigo
- Ability to read and understand API documentation
- Experience with SQL

This is a job for ERP consultants that want to specialize in data integration. Every company today use between 20-100 different business productivity applications. These applications need to share data with each other in many different ways - to make the business users as informed and productive as possible. The heart of a business is the CRM, ERP or CSM - and most integrations involve these applications - so we are looking for someone that has experience with one or all of those types of applications.
The Role
This role is all about Business Data. Some days this will be working on complex data integrations, the next a virtual integration project and the next focused on cross platform reporting. You will be hands on with building integration solutions for a wide range of clients, while at the same time managing those projects to success.
The primary tasks will include but not be limited to:
1. Scoping and designing integration solutions
2. Building data integrations with SmartConnect.
3. Testing the integrations solutions
4. Training clients on how to manage the integration solution
5. Document the integration scenario
6. Managing your own projects through project meetings, setting expectations.
7. Manage projects to budget
8. Providing feedback on local needs and requirements
9. Building templates to streamline future projects.
What we are looking for?
The ideal person will have a technical knowledge of mid-market ERP or CRM. Ideally you will understand the web services, API's, have a strong grasp of SQL and be confident working with data. You are the kind of person that likes to be challenged, solve problems, and enjoys working independently (inside a very supportive team structure).
- Technical experience with Dynamics Business Central, Dynamics CE, SalesForce, Dynamics GP, NetSuite or F&O
- Experience with SmartConnect, Tibco Scribe, Dell Boomi or Celigo
- Ability to read and understand API documentation
- Experience with SQL
- An understanding of business process and business data flows
- Top Shelf verbal and written communication
- Experience managing projects from quote to sign off.
The Company
eOne solutions is a small dynamic team of 50, that only employs great people with an entrepreneurial mindset. We are the authors of two primary tools (SmartConnect and Popdock) that are sold and implemented through our partner channel. eOne's team of implementation consultants support are partners and their mid-market customers to deliver world class solutions.
